# Baïkal Server - CalDAV+CardDAV Server

This is an incomplete **development version** of Baïkal Server 2 - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE - seriously.

Baïkal2 is based on SabreDAV and Symfony2.

## Installation (for the braves)

**Notes:**

* composer is required for the installation
* the nodejs less compiler is required for the installation; Baïkal will look for it in these pathes `[/opt/lessc/lib, /usr/lib/node_modules, /usr/local/share/npm/lib/node_modules/]`; if yours is installed somewhere else, add your path to the property `assetic.filters.less.node_paths` in `app/config/config.yml`

**Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeromeschneider/Baikal2.git
cd Baikal2
composer install
php app/console doctrine:database:create
php app/console doctrine:schema:create
php app/console assetic:dump
php app/console assets:install
```

Then edit `app/config/security.yml` to change the password (and the username if you feel like it) for the static user "staticadmin" (default pass is "password", so better do it before anything else).

## Usage

Baïkal now features a frontend and an admin (hosted at /admin)

You may log in frontend or backend.

When the database is freshly created, no users are available. You then have to log in using "staticadmin" / "password" (or whatever you changed it to) to create an admin user (with admin role).

## State of the dev

As of 2013-10-27, DAV is served, admin is somewhat functionnal. Frontend is not coded at all.

Admin features a visual "Calendar view" (functionnal, but lacks features) and an "Addressbook view" (not functionnal).

## Roadmap

* Add unit tests
* Finish backend
* Finish Calendar and Addressbook View
* Code frontend
* Add "Todo list" feature
* Add "Notes" feature ?
* Add Import
* Add export
* Add calendar sharing
* Add JSON api.
* Review B1 github feature requests, and implement the most demanded ones.
